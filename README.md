# Weather-App
This project is a Weather App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from an API (like OpenWeatherMap) and displays the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and location. The project demonstrates API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch/async-await), and dynamic DOM updates.
